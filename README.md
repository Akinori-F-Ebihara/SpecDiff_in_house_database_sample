# Example in-house Database
This repository contains example data used as the in-house database in the following two papers:  
  
__Specular- and Diffuse-reflection-based Face Spoofing Detection for Mobile Devices. (IJCB2020)__  
__Efficient Face Spoofing Detection with Flash. (IEEE TBIOM)__  

Please note that,  
 - The database is available for academic research purposes only.  
 - Modification and re-distribution are strictly prohibited.
 - Face images of a subject cannot be published or displayed in public without permission.  
 
 ## Description
 Each folder under the data folder contains photos of the same ID taken with flash ($P^{(f)}$) and without flash ($P^{(b)}$), alternately.  
 For example, the first file under a folder "ID000", IMG_0324.JPG, is a photo taken with flash. The second file, IMG_0325.JPG is a photo taken without flash. These two photos are taken within few hundreds of milliseconds. The third and fourth files are another pair of photos taken with and without flash, respectively.
